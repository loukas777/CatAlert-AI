# CatAlert-AI

The CatAlert-AI is a program that detects the presence of cats in a live video through the Jetson detectNet network.

Purpose:  This program is originally meant to keep cats out of your garden by sending the resident/user a notification saying a cat is in their garden. But
          it can also be used for other intentions.
          
Steps:  1.  ssh into your nano
        2.  Upload the script
        3.  Set up your camera wherever you want to know when a cat's there
        4.  Run the script
